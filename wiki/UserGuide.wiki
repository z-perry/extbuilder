  Before you start to editing a Ext page, make sure you opened Outline View and Properties View. If not, please click Window->Show View to open these two views.

  === Editor View ===
  It’s a multi-pages editor contains a source code editor and a UI editor. 
  In source code editor, you can see the real code extbuilder generate for you. Please focus the initUIComponents function.
  In UI editor, you can see one palette at left side and a embedded browser at right side. With the embedded browser, you can preview the code generated by ExtBuilder.

  === Outline View ===
  The outline view is a component tree view. You can select specific component in the view. 

  === Properties View ===
  The most important view you have to deal. In this view, you can set the configuration of one component.
  For example: 
  For a Panel component, you may set the title property to ‘MyPanel’, the layout property to ‘Border’, the width property to ‘100’, etc.
  For a GridPanel component, you may set the store property and columns property.
  All you change make to a component take effect immediately. Both the code editor and UI editor will change. It’s a good way to watch your settings how change the UI to your wanted style.

  === Drag Components ===
  In UI editor, you can see a palette with some components in several folders.
  Now extbuilder supports most components in latest Ext 2.2
  You could click one component, such as a Panel then move the mouse to outline view, there must be a component named panel, it's the root component of one panel class. Click the mouse again, then the root panel component now have a child panel.
  In the way, you can use any components and organize the component tree as you wish.
  Although you may think drag a component and drop it to a canvas is better, but that means ExtBuilder need to implement all Ext components drawing,behavior and layout in Java code. From my opinion, this way is the fastest way to build a GUI page.

= How to =

== Set Properties ==
  Ext component have many properties. ExtBuilder divide these properties into two categories: common properties and advanced properties. By default, only common properties are shown,you can show advanced properties by click the Advanced button at the top toolbar  of Properties View.
  Properties can be string, integer,drop down list. Some special properties like store, toolbar,buttons,columns Model will pop up a dialog for user set.

== Set Layout == 
   There are two panels, one parent, one child.
   # Create a new Ext page
   # Set the root panel's tilte to 'ParentPanel'
   # Add a Panel to page root panel component
   # Set the child panel's title to 'ChildPanel'
   # Click the parent panel on outline view
   # Set the parent panel's layout to 'Border'
   # Click the child panel on outline view
   # Set the child panel's region to 'center'
   Because Ext border layout require a center region component, so when you set the layout to 'border', and not set the child panel's region to 'center', you may see some error message in browser, it's not a bug of ExtBuilder.

== FormPanel ==
   # Create a new Ext page
   # Add a FormPanel to root panel
   # Set the FormPanel's layout to 'column'
   # Add two Panels to FormPanel, set columnWidth to '.5'
   # Set these two Panels's layout to 'form'
   # Add 4 TextField to these Two Panel, each have two

   Then you get a two column form panel
